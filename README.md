Homework 1 requires us to create a website. I have satisfied each of the requirements as follows:

1. Create a single, scrollable web-page with categories about you as a researcher. At a minimum, these should be: About (with information about you), Publications (with a list of publications), Research Interests (with a list of interests that you have regarding the research you work on)
2. Use JavaScript to set up a way to populate your research papers from a data file. The publications are stored in `static/publications.json`
3. Add some form of SVG to the webpage to show some aspect of your information in visual form. I added my portrait in the **Skills** section and the companies logos in the "Experience" section as SVGs.
